Work on the copy of the project. The master project is **Read-Only**, meaning you can edit, but it will not be saved when you close the master project. To avoid total loss of your work, remember to make a copy.\n","\n","2. **Completing the Project**: You are required to work on and complete all tasks in the provided project. Be disciplined and ensure that you thoroughly engage with each task.\n","   \n","3. **Creating a Google Drive Folder**: Each of you must create a new folder on your Google Drive. This will be the repository for all your completed project files, aiding you in keeping your work organized and accessible.\n","   \n","4. **Uploading Completed Project**: Upon completion of your project, make sure to upload all necessary files, involving codes, reports, and related documents into the created Google Drive folder. Save this link in the 'Student Identity' section and also provide it as the last parameter in the `submit` function that has been provided.\n","   \n","5. **Sharing Folder Link**: You're required to share the link to your project Google Drive folder. This is crucial for the submission and evaluation of your project.\n","   \n","6. **Setting Permission to Public**: Please make sure your Google Drive folder is set to public. This allows your instructor to access your solutions and assess your work correctly.\n","\n","Adhering to these procedures will facilitate a smooth project evaluation process for you and the reviewers."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XeK2fKDrZ0-s"},"source":["## Project Description\n","\n","The Deep Learning Projects are divided into two parts, the first is the Calculations worth 30% in this notebook and the second one is Pytorch Project worth 70%.\n","\n","The two projects will help you gain experience to learn about Deep Learning in detail.\n","\n","Happy coding!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Lgd8szRCZ0-t"},"source":["## Grading Criteria\n","\n","There are 4 primary tasks in this project, all have the same weight.
